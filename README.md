# portfolio

A simple portfolio website made in reactJS and animated with [react-spring](https://www.react-spring.io) where I'll put some of my projects.

### How to get a preview ?

This website will soon be availible on a custom domain name and hosted by github pages.

While it is still in development, you may see it by cloning the source files
> `git clone git@github.com:PaulErny/portfolio.git`

Navigating to the folder containing the react app
> `cd portfolio/portfolio-front`

Starting the development server
> `npm start`
>
> *Make sure that you have **node** and **react** installed*

Once the development server is up and running, open your web navigator of choice and navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
